The big update is going to arrive here soon!
Version 1.1 will feature many big changes to the way the script works, 
and will hopefully fix any existing problems.

Here are all the changes:
- Dropping command-line support
- Can be used as an include
- Can be used directly (script.php?ip=127.0.0.1&port=3127) or (script.php?file=proxies.txt)
