# V1.0 Docs
*Note: Use of V1.0 is __NOT RECOMMENDED__, it's Working status is currently unknown, and support will be dropped by the end of May 2016*

This version was entirely command-line only, and does not support any of the new features. 
Use via command line:

```
$php index.php proxylist.txt 500 1 -nolicense -useonly
```

Recommended timeout is 1 second. 
Here are all the command line arguments listed below:

````
$php index.php [Proxy List File fmt PROXY:PORT] [Number of Threads 50-500 recommended] [timeout in seconds, 1 recommended] [-nolicense if you don't want to display the guff about license] [-useonly if you don't want the "-----" stuff]
````
