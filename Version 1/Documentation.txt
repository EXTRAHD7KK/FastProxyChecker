This version was entirely command-line only, and does not support any of the new features. Use via command line:

$php index.php proxylist.txt 500 1 -nolicense -useonly

Recommended timeout is 1. Command line arguments as follow:

$php index.php [Proxy List File fmt PROXY:PORT] [Number of Threads 50-500 recommended] [timeout in seconds, 1 recommended] [-nolicense if you don't want to display the guff about license] [-useonly if you don't want the "-----" stuff]
